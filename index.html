I have a love for all things mechanical and have spent many hours working on cars, tractors, and motorcycles. This experience has taught me the importance of attention to detail and problem-solving, skills that translate well to coding. I am also interested in two-way radio communication, such as CB, and have an interest in aviation. These hobbies have taught me about the importance of clear communication and following established procedures, which are important skills in software development. I am also passionate about fitness and believe that my dedication to physical health translates to a strong and driven work ethic. I am always eager to learn and improve my skills, and I approach every task with readiness and enthusiasm.</p>
